## Alek Westover

Right now I'm working on AI safety at [Redwood Research](https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/).  
I recently graduated from MIT where I studied Math, CS and AI.  
Before working on AI safety I did theoretical comptuer science research  
(data structures, online algorithms, and algorithmic graph theory).

## Go on a date

I enjoy having close relationships with people, and think that  
dating is probably a great way to make a close connection with someone.  
If you're potentially interested in going on a date,  
or know someone I should maybe go on a date with,  
please read [this short document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rtnefza06BXaK4INbf2V_6H8rLDPSQ-Hj58g4tx5eA0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.warnd42sksz) and then contact me.

## Blog
I occasionally put some unpolished thoughts on my blog [here](https://alekw.com).
My posts fall into the following categories:

1. Technical notes (Math/TCS/ML/AI Safety).
2. Life Optimization.
3. Philosophy.
