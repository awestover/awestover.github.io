Right now I'm working on AI safety at [ARC](https://www.alignment.org/).  
I recently graduated from MIT where I studied Math, CS and AI.  
I've done research in model organisms (trying to find empirical
evidence for theoretical concerns about AI Misalignment),  
and pure TCS (data structures, online algorithms, and algorithmic
graph theory).

## Blog
I occasionally put some unpolished thoughts on my blog [here](https://awestover.github.io/thoughts).
My posts fall into the following categories:

1. Technical notes (Math/TCS/ML/AI Safety).
2. Life Optimization.
3. Philosophy.
